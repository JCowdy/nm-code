logger.js
=========
top/general
- Pulled chalk require statement to top of file
- Created TRANSPORT_ACTIONS to store default transport actions based on level
- Created default root and level constants

constructor
- defaulted config param to empty obj to prevent read on undefined

log()
- Removed assignment of params data and level to this context, seems unnecessary.
  Reserve this context/root for high level logger data. Pass the params to createLogObject.

createLogObject()
- When checking if data is a string use triple equals
- Replace string literal 'info' with new DEFAULT_LEVEL

transport()
- Check if the passed level has an action define in TRANSPORT_ACTIONS and use it.
  If not use the DEFAULT_LEVEL action
